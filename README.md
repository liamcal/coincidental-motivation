# Coincidental Motivation

After seeing various infuriating images such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/N9B3VQ2.jpg?1) circulate the interwebs over the years, and prompted by a tweet from a friend, I decided to make a short python script to have a go at randomly generating other "motivational" coincidences.

## Usage
```
$ python3 motivation_generator.py <words_filepath>
```

Two lists of English words are provided, but feel free to substitute your own. Word lists which contain more commonly used words tend to result in more entertaining results...

If not provided `<words_filepath>` will default to `'words/words.txt'`. 

Feel free to tweet at [@liamcallaway](https://twitter.com/liamcallaway) if you find any fun ones.
